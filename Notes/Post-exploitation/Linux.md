## General Linux tips

To get back to previous dir `cd -`

You may want to use **sucrack** over hydra if SSH is disabled from outside. Note that sucrack works only for one user at a time though.

Find only files (not dirs) in current dir and subdirs

```bash
find . -type f -ls
```

Find files readable by current user

```bash
find / -type f -readable -ls
```

Find files owned by jimmy

```bash
find / -user jimmy -ls 2>/dev/null
```

### Search files by modified dates

To find files modified between 01-01-2020 and 03-01-2020:

```shell
find / -newermt 2020-01-01 ! -newermt 2020-01-03 2>/dev/null
```

To confirm the file modified date

```shell
stat filename
```

#### /etc/sshd

**DenyUsers** can be used to deny SSH logins so try `su user` instead.

#### mysql

This is equivalent to `SHOW COLUMNS FROM <table_name>`
```sql
describe <table_name>
```
#### git

Find git/svn repos by searching for `.git` and `.svn`
```shell
find . -name .git
```
